## What Is Sentinel?

Sentinel is a dual-module detection system that watches for suspicious behaviour across two domains simultaneously — system activity and financial transactions. Both modules feed into a Central Risk Engine that produces a unified risk score (0–100), alert level, reason flags, and a persistent incident log for every event. A React dashboard provides a live ops view into everything.

##  Quickstart

### Backend

```bash
# 1. Clone and create virtual environment
git clone https://github.com/keletso-m/Security-monitoring-and-Fraud-Detection-System.git
cd Security-monitoring-and-Fraud-Detection-System
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Initialise the database
python scripts/init_db.py

# 4. Start the API server
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

API runs on **http://localhost:8000** — visit **/docs** for the interactive explorer.

### Dashboard

```bash
# In a second terminal
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Dashboard runs on **http://localhost:3000**

### Fire test data

```bash
# In a third terminal
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python simulator/run.py
```

Fires 5 synthetic scenarios through the full pipeline (🟢 LOW → 🔴 CRITICAL). Results appear live in the dashboard.

---

##  Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

**39 passed, 0 failed**

Covers all 4 activity signals, all 4 transaction signals, risk engine blending, combined signals, and full pipeline integration.

##  Risk Scoring

Transparent, weighted scoring — not a black box. Every score comes with plain-English reason flags.

**Activity signals**

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| Failed logins > 5 | +30 |
| Access between 00:00–05:00 UTC | +15 |
| IP not in known allowlist | +25 |
| Suspicious command detected | +30 |

**Transaction signals**

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| Amount > ZAR 10,000 | +25 |
| 3+ transactions in 60 seconds | +30 |
| Location mismatch from last transaction | +25 |
| New / unrecognised device | +20 |

**Blending** — activity and transaction scores are combined 50/50. A combined signal (both detectors fire) produces a significantly higher score than either alone.

**Alert levels**

| Score | Level |
|---|---|
| 0–24 | 🟢 LOW |
| 25–49 | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| 50–74 | 🟠 HIGH |
| 75–100 | 🔴 CRITICAL |

##  Design Decisions

**Why rule-based scoring instead of ML?** Rules are transparent, debuggable, and explainable which matters in security. An ML layer is planned for v2 on top of a working, auditable baseline.

**Why SQLite?** Zero infrastructure to run locally. The DB layer is abstracted in `risk_engine.py` so PostgreSQL is a config change, not a rewrite.

**Why a unified risk engine?** A combined signal is more actionable than two separate alerts. A user flagged by both detectors simultaneously is a much stronger indicator than either alone Scenario 5 in the simulator scores 92/100 for exactly this reason.

**Why separate frontend and backend?** The React app talks to FastAPI via a REST API, keeping the two independently deployable. The `proxy` field in `package.json` handles CORS in development in production you'd put both behind a reverse proxy like nginx.
