# Sentinel — Security Monitoring & Fraud Detection System

> A unified mini security operations platform that monitors system activity and scores financial transactions for risk — built to be real, extensible, and interview-ready.

---

## What Is This?

Sentinel is a dual-module detection system that watches for suspicious behavior across two domains simultaneously:

- **System activity** — failed logins, unusual access times, unknown IPs, suspicious commands
- **Financial transactions** — high-value transfers, rapid repeated payments, location mismatches, new devices

Both modules feed into a **Central Risk Engine** that produces a unified risk score, reason flags, alert level, and incident log for every event.

This is not a toy project. It's not a fantasy enterprise system either. It's a focused, honest piece of software that solves a real problem — and one you can fully defend in a technical interview.

## Core Features

### Intrusion & Activity Detection
Monitors system logs and events for:
- Multiple failed login attempts within a time window
- Access occurring at unusual hours
- Requests from unknown or flagged IP addresses
- Suspicious command patterns in logs

### Transaction Risk Scoring
Analyzes financial events for:
- Unusually high transaction amounts
- Rapid repeated transactions from the same account
- Geographic location mismatches
- Transactions from new or unrecognized devices

### Central Risk Engine
Unifies both modules into a single decision layer that outputs:
- **Risk Score** — weighted numeric score (0–100)
- **Reason Flags** — human-readable list of what triggered the score
- **Alert Level** — LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL
- **Incident Log** — persistent record of every flagged event

### Alert System
- Console alerts with color-coded severity
- Structured log file output
- Incident storage in SQLite database

No message queues. No microservices. No distributed infrastructure. Just a clean, well-structured Python system that does what it says.

## Risk Scoring Logic

Sentinel uses a **transparent, weighted scoring model** — not a black box. Every score comes with a plain-English explanation.

### Activity Score Factors

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| Failed logins > 5 in 10 minutes | +30 |
| Access between 00:00 – 05:00 | +15 |
| IP not in known list | +25 |
| Suspicious command in log | +30 |

### Transaction Score Factors

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| Amount > threshold | +25 |
| 3+ transactions in 60 seconds | +30 |
| Location mismatch from last transaction | +25 |
| New device fingerprint | +20 |

### Alert Levels

| Score Range | Level |
|---|---|
| 0 – 24 | 🟢 LOW |
| 25 – 49 | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| 50 – 74 | 🟠 HIGH |
| 75 – 100 | 🔴 CRITICAL |

## Version Roadmap

### Version 1 — Core System *(current)*
- Rule-based detection for both modules
- Simulated event input
- SQLite storage
- CLI alerts + log file
- FastAPI interface

### 🔧 Version 2 — One Meaningful Upgrade *(future add ons)*
- [ ] Web dashboard (React or simple HTML/JS)
- [ ] Email/SMS alerts via SendGrid or Twilio
- [ ] Basic ML model to replace manual thresholds
- [ ] Apache Kafka as the event pipeline


---

## Design Decisions

**Why rule-based scoring instead of ML?**
Rules are transparent, debuggable, and explainable — which matters in security contexts. Version 2 can introduce a model layer on top of an already-working system rather than replacing one that doesn't exist yet.

**Why SQLite?**
It requires zero infrastructure to run locally, making this genuinely easy to set up and demo. The database layer is abstracted so PostgreSQL is a config change, not a rewrite.

**Why a unified engine?**
A combined risk signal is more actionable than two separate alerts. A user flagged by both the activity detector *and* the transaction scorer simultaneously is a much stronger signal than either alone.
